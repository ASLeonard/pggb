A pangenome models the full set of genomic elements in a given species or clade. It can efficiently be encoded in the
form of a variation graph, a type of sequence graph that embeds the linear sequences as paths in the graphs themselves.

To exchange pangenomes, the community frequently uses a strict subset of the Graphical Fragment Assembly ``GFA`` format
version 1 (`GFAv1 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8006571/#FN8>`_).
